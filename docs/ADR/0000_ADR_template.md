# ADR-001: Use MongoDB as Primary Database

## Date

2025-08-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application needs to store flexible document-based data with frequent schema changes during development. We need a database solution that:

- Supports rapid development and iteration
- Handles document-based data structures effectively
- Provides good scalability
- Has strong community support and tooling

## Decision

We will use MongoDB as our primary database solution. This decision is supported by:

- Native support for document-based data structures
- Schema flexibility for rapid development
- Strong Node.js integration
- Existing team experience with the technology
- Good scalability characteristics

## Consequences

Positive:

- Flexible schema allows rapid iterations during development
- Rich query capabilities
- Good Node.js driver support
- Built-in scaling capabilities

Negative:

- Need to carefully manage indexes for performance
- Team needs to be aware of MongoDB best practices
- Some complexity in managing relationships between documents

## Alternatives Considered

1. PostgreSQL

   - More rigid schema
   - Better for complex transactions
   - Not chosen due to need for schema flexibility

2. DynamoDB
   - Excellent scaling
   - AWS native integration
   - Not chosen due to more complex query patterns and team familiarity
